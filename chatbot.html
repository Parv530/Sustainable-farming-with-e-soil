        // List of predefined answers based on the provided information
        const answers = {
            "What is e-soil?": "E-soil is a conductive cultivation substrate for hydroponic systems, using low-powered electric currents to stimulate plant root growth. It consists of cellulose and a conductive polymer called PEDOT.",
            "How does e-soil help plants grow faster?": "E-soil improves plant growth by stimulating the root system with low-voltage electrical currents, leading to enhanced nutrient uptake and faster growth.",
            "What is hydroponics?": "Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using a nutrient-rich water solution and inert mediums like perlite or rockwool.",
            "How does hydroponics work?": "In hydroponics, plants are grown in water with dissolved nutrients instead of soil. Their roots are exposed to the nutrient solution, ensuring they receive oxygen and essential minerals.",
            "What are the benefits of hydroponics?": "Hydroponics allows for higher yields, better use of land and water, and the ability to grow in controlled, urban environments with limited arable land.",
            "What is electro-culture farming?": "Electro-culture farming is a technique that uses electricity to stimulate plant growth, typically with low-voltage systems that increase yield and improve nutrient absorption.",
            "Who invented electro-culture farming?": "Electro-culture farming was explored by scientists like Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare in the 18th century, and it has evolved to focus on low-voltage electrical stimulation of plants.",
            "How does electro-culture farming work?": "Electro-culture farming uses electrical currents to mimic the effects of lightning or stimulate plants, boosting their growth and enhancing their nutrient absorption.",
            "What are the benefits of electro-culture farming?": "The main benefits of electro-culture farming include increased crop yields, faster growth rates, and reduced dependency on chemical fertilizers.",
            "What is the history of electro-culture farming?": "Electro-culture farming dates back to the 18th century when scientists like Pierre Bertholon experimented with atmospheric electricity. It has evolved to use low-voltage electricity to stimulate plant growth.",
            "What is the difference between high-voltage and low-voltage electro-culture farming?": "High-voltage electro-culture was used historically to mimic lightning effects, while low-voltage electro-culture, which is currently in use, offers a safer, more sustainable way to stimulate plant growth.",
            "What materials are used in hydroponic systems?": "Common materials used in hydroponics include inert mediums like perlite, rockwool, clay pellets, peat moss, and vermiculite to support plant roots in the absence of soil.",
            "Why is e-soil better than mineral wool in hydroponics?": "E-soil is more environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and requires less energy to produce compared to mineral wool, making it a more sustainable option for hydroponics.",
            "What is the role of electricity in hydroponic farming?": "Electricity in hydroponic farming, especially through e-soil, stimulates the plant roots, enhancing nutrient uptake, growth rates, and overall plant health.",
            "How does e-soil improve nutrient uptake?": "E-soil facilitates better nutrient absorption by creating an optimal environment for root growth, allowing plants to process minerals like nitrogen more effectively.",
            "Can e-soil reduce the need for chemical fertilizers?": "Yes, e-soil reduces the need for chemical fertilizers by improving the efficiency of nutrient uptake, allowing plants to thrive without excess chemicals.",
            "What is the research behind e-soil development?": "Research at Linkoping University in Sweden, led by Eleni Stavrinidou, focused on using a blend of cellulose and conductive polymers to create e-soil, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting plant growth.",
            "How do low-voltage electric currents benefit plants?": "Low-voltage electric currents stimulate the roots of plants, encouraging faster growth, higher yields, and better nutrient absorption without harming the plants.",
            "Why is cellulose used in e-soil?": "Cellulose is a natural, biodegradable biopolymer that provides the base for e-soil, making it eco-friendly and sustainable for long-term use in hydroponic systems.",
            "How does e-soil compare to traditional soil-based farming?": "E-soil is more efficient than traditional soil farming because it requires less water, eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers, and can increase crop yields in controlled environments.",
            "How can hydroponics help solve global food shortages?": "Hydroponics can help address food shortages by allowing crops to be grown in urban areas, using less land and water, and providing a more sustainable solution to traditional farming methods.",
            "What are the challenges of hydroponic farming?": "Challenges of hydroponic farming include the need for constant monitoring of water levels and pH, energy consumption for lighting and pumps, and the potential for disease spread in water systems.",
            "Is e-soil biodegradable?": "Yes, e-soil is made of cellulose and is fully biodegradable, breaking down naturally over time without harming the environment.",
            "How much growth boost can e-soil provide to crops?": "Studies have shown that e-soil can boost crop growth by up to 50%, as seen in tests with barley seedlings in hydroponic systems.",
            "What are the applications of hydroponics in urban farming?": "Hydroponics is increasingly being used in urban farming to grow food in cities, where arable land is scarce and water resources are limited.",
            "How does e-soil help plants process nitrogen?": "E-soil enhances nitrogen processing by improving the root system's efficiency in absorbing and utilizing nitrogen from the surrounding nutrient solution.",
            "What is the significance of using a conductive polymer like PEDOT in e-soil?": "PEDOT helps create an electrically conductive environment within the e-soil, which is crucial for enhancing the plant roots' response to electrical stimulation.",
            "What are the key advantages of hydroponic farming over traditional farming?": "Hydroponics offers higher yields, better resource efficiency, faster growth, and the ability to grow in controlled environments, making it ideal for urban and resource-constrained areas.",
            "How can hydroponic farming help with climate change?": "Hydroponic farming can mitigate climate change by reducing the need for chemical fertilizers, conserving water, and enabling efficient, low-emission crop production in urban settings.",
            "What are the potential future applications of e-soil and hydroponics?": "E-soil and hydroponics hold great potential for large-scale urban farming, vertical farms, and sustainable agriculture, helping to meet the growing food demands of the global population."
